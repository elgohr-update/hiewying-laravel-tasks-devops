# Automated Deployment for Laravel Application
### ITTRALEE Year 4 Semester 2: Development Operations Module
The purpose of the project is to build an automated deployment pipeline for an application, which includes compile, test, assemble, and deploy the application to at least one environment, as the project progresses through the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). 
<br><br>
The chosen application for this project is written in PHP using Laravel and Vue frameworks. It is a task application which allows users to add and delete the tasks. The application was cloned from [here](https://github.com/connor11528/laravel-vue-tasks ) and renamed to laravel-tasks-devops.
